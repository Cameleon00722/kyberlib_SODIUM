## Overview üìñ

A Robust Rust Library for CRYSTALS-Kyber Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Features ‚ú®

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `kyberlib`.

### Installation

To install `kyberlib`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on
your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the
instructions on the [Rust website][13].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `kyberlib`
using the following command:

```shell
cargo install kyberlib
```

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
kyberlib --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**1.71.1** or later (stable).

### Platform support

`kyberlib` is supported and tested on the following platforms:

### Tier 1 platforms üèÜ

| | Operating System | Target | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‚úÖ | Linux   | aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux systems on ARM architecture |
| ‚úÖ | Linux   | i686-unknown-linux-gnu | 32-bit Linux (kernel 3.2+, glibc 2.17+) |
| ‚úÖ | Linux   | x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux (kernel 2.6.32+, glibc 2.11+) |

The [GitHub Actions][10] shows the platforms in which the `kyberlib`
library tests are run.

### Documentation

**Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information. You can find our documentation on [docs.rs][8], [lib.rs][9] and
[crates.io][7].

## Usage üìñ

To use the `kyberlib` library in your project, add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
kyberlib = "0.0.1"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate kyberlib;
use kyberlib::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

To get started with `kyberlib`, you can use the examples provided in the
`examples` directory of the project.

To run the examples, clone the repository and run the following command
in your terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example kyberlib
```
